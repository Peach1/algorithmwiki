Area / Volume 
============
   * **Area** is a single numeric value that describes the amount of space a 2D polygon takes up.
   * **Volume** is a single numeric value that describes the amount of space a 3D mesh takes up

An area/volume is stored as a float or double; integers are rarely used because volumes are rarely equal to a whole number
